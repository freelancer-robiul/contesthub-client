      </h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-slate-300 mb-3">
        ContestHub is a community-driven platform for creative contests. It was
        built for students, freelancers and teams who want real-world practice,
        not just tutorial projects.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-slate-300 mb-3">
        Contest creators can launch focused challenges with clear prizes.
        Participants can submit their best work, get discovered and grow a
        public portfolio of wins and participations.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-slate-300">
        We designed ContestHub to be fair, simple and transparent. No hidden
        rules, no confusing ratings—just clear deadlines, real winners and a
        visible track record of your progress.
